## Introduction

This repository is for the code developed for the Memory Game project as part of the Front End Nanodegree.

To try out the repo, just clone it and open the `index.html` in a browser. You are now ready to play the interactive Memory Game.

The `index.html` contains the initial DOM provided by the starter project and the DOM elements for a Modal and the Timer.

The file `js/app.js`contains all the logic. Most of the code is around DOM manipulation using JS except for the Modal implementation which I built using jQuery and Bootstrap. There are a lot of comments in the file that help in understanding how the code has been structured.

The file `css/app.cs` is the same from the starter project except for the css animation that I use when the cards match and when they do not.

## Contributing

This repository is my code. If you try the repo, play the game and are interested in contributing, please make a pull request.
